          <p style="text-align:justify">Manny Pacquiao is one of the World's most accomplished person not just in the boxing ring but outside of it. He is a ranked military reservist (Colonel) in the Reserve Force of the Philippine Army. He also once played as both a professional basketball player and coach in the Philippine Basketball Association. He can also play a good chess game. On a good day, Manny can finish off the 9 ball without having to sit down and wait for his turn in billards.</p>
           <p style="text-align:justify">Pacquiao loves to entertain an audience beyond sports. Pacman has made no secret his love for singing, and tales have been told about his house parties with full-on karaoke sessions that lasted till the wee hours of the morning. Manny also have recorded a few songs and an album in which a lot of people actually enjoyed. Aside from singing, he also starred in movies and other entertainment media and advertisements.</p>
           <p style="text-align:justify">Manny Pacquiao loves to serve his fellow country men and not just to entertain them with his fists and charming personality. He is in fact, one of the few breeds in the world of politicians who really have that passion to help and serve unconditionally. You can read more of his political career on the Wikipedia link at the bottom of this page. If you can, try google not only his charity but the many good deeds this man has done not only for his countrmen but in the world.</p>
           <p style="text-align:justify">It is no secret that Senator Manny Pacquiao is a man of God. We all saw him and his routine before and after every fight, and that he steps in to his corner and make a prayer. And when he does pray, he pray not only for himself but for the safety of his opponent as well. Aside from building a few Christian Churches and contributing to the community, not many people know that he is actually a good preacher of the bible and of the words of God.</p>
           <p style="text-align:justify">Finally, with so many accomplishments and accollades (there's just too many to mention) and his contribution to the world, there is one important role the Pacman has played privately and behind closed doors that not many people actually see. He is a family man every family member wishes to have. A very loving husband to his famous and gorgeous wife Jinkee, a caring father to his beautiful yet well-mannered kids, and a good son to a very passionate mother-mommy Dionisia who on her own, established a cult following.
